This is a demo project using Crypto++ for iOS.
See Crypto++ project page http://www.cryptopp.com/ for more info.

Build the static universal library:
  1. Open the Terminal and enter external/scripts directory.
  2. Type ./build-cryptopp.sh
  3. On success, external/include/cryptopp/*.h and external/lib/libcryptopp.a
     exist.

To confirm that libcryptopp.a is build for multiple architectures run:
lipo -info external/lib/libcryptopp.a

Expected output is:
Architectures in the fat file: libcryptopp.a are: i386 armv6 armv7


Build the demo app:
  1. Double click Cryptopp-for-iOS.xcodeproj
  2. Run with XCode.

Currently, the example only shows the use of the hash algorithms MD5 and SHA.

License:
  Crypto++ is public domain, therefore I put this demo app into the public
  domain, too.

Have fun with Crypto++ on iOS devices!
